It seems he has been kidnapped as a baby along with some other kids and was held captive until the age of 6. Then he was taken away by social workers and spent most of his teenage years in an orphanage. Because of his strange ability and at times downright psychotic behaviour, he was admitted into different asylums multiple times, where he also was experimented on. At 16 he was placed into the Londinium Asylum for the criminally insane. He managed to escape for good when he was 17 with his roommate Elias. Nowdays he's known as \"the fast thief\", and his name is known all around the L-I continent, although no one has actually seen him in person. Psychology \u00b6 Personality \u00b6 Core Traits: Erratic, Chaotic, YOLO attitude, Chronic prankster, Resourceful, Impulsive, also... fast Key Motivations: Never really had long term goals, lives in the moment... Relationships \u00b6 Dora: Ouch, just- hey, let\u2019s talk it out, yeah? Like two grown adults. Jackaby: Yeah, that\u2019s what I always tell Elias, but he\u2019s always like: I hope you die in a ditch somewhere and alligators will tear up your lifeless body\u2026 Julian : Good friend, partner in crime Dora : Good friend, demon summoning partner Elias : Roommate, says he's a friend but it's one hell of a toxic relationship on both sides Ben : Julian's brother, stole his door that one time Leon : Knows him through Dora, kidnapped him once ADHD, Cleptomania and PTSD \u00b6 Given the nature of his abilities and history Jackaby suffers from several mental health issues. He seems to exhibit clear ADHD traits, mainly showcased through his constant impulsivity, hyperactivity, and lowered focus. His impulsivity also plays into his cleptomania - Jackaby's house is full of stolen items of the same kind, he \"collects\" all kinds of items ranging from every possible tea kind to hats and books. While the rooms are ironically enough, ordered; all walls are filled with things stuffed into shelves from top to bottom, it's clear he has a hoarding problem. It's hard to say the exact causes of this behaviour, it's probably the result of his ADHD & unstable childhood. Jackaby also suffers from PTSD from his time at the asylum. He rarely talks about his inner thoughts with anyone, so one can only guess what's going on in his mind. He seems to have hard time letting go of past relationships of any kind even when they are toxic. Appearance \u00b6 Physical Appearance \u00b6 Jackaby is on the taller side as far as L-I continent is concerned. He's slim but athletic, doesn't neccesarily work out but his physique benefits from him running all day long at impossible speeds. He usually wears a long grey ragged coat with two sets of buttons which he rarely ever closes. He usually just throws it on to make use of the giant pockets on the sides. Skills \u00b6 Special Abilities: Can run really fast, to the point it can be almost comparable to teleportation.

His parents are powerful sorcerers that were part of the VOTHD and supposedly they were demon slayers too before Julian and Benedict were born. Julian was kind of a family prodigy, born sorcerer unlike his brother who's a wizard and had to study hard to get his powers. This fact made Julian naturally arrogant and egoistic, and he constantly insults his brother as a result to this day. Despite this, Benedict is still trying to get on Julian's good side in hopes of improving their relationship. Julian went to School of Evocation with Benedict and Kevin. Julian works mainly alone and has many criminal contacts despite not being a criminal himself. He also has an affiliation with VOTHD because of his parents, although he's not an official member. Psychology \u00b6 Dora: I\u2019ll guess. Is it Julian\u2019s doing? Ari: Julian is the- Julian: The handsome sorcerer. Yes. Personality \u00b6 Core Traits: Intelligent, Reckless, Arrogant but Unbothered by many things, Confident, Always has to have the last word, Resourceful, Self-absorbed at times Key Motivations: Seems keen on gaining knowledge and power especially in fields like Arcane Arts but not necessarily in order to get recognition and success, he\u2019s just naturally curious about his own nature and the world Relationships \u00b6 Ben : his older brother and sole nemesis Dora : frenemy but also one of the few people who happened to stick around him for the long run Jackaby : kind of a friend, partner in crime (literally and figuratively) Mentor : his teacher and a role model Recklessness and living on \u201cedge\u201d \u00b6 Julian has shown over the years some very much reckless tendencies, throwing himself constantly into dangerous situations for no reason other than curiosity, low self-preservation and very much reversed priorities. Where other people care about their safety and safety of others, Julian cares about gaining knowledge. Even though he has high-quality education and comes from a privileged family, instead of working a job or being part of a research he\u2019s always been sort of a freelancer, never working a stable job - his current housing situation is an \u201cabandoned\u201d house he won in a card game which could have cost him his liver. These traits can also be showcased through his long-term drug abuse. While he rarely ever indulges in alcohol, he seems to have affinity for marijuana, morphine and cocaine. He thinks of himself as a recreational user, mostly abusing substances out of boredom or curiosity, but he\u2019s been shown to turn to them after enduring stressful situations as well. Appearance \u00b6 Julian: I\u2019m Julian. Last name\u2019s not important. And I\u2019m the best sorcerer in the whole world. Well, TOP 3 at least. And the pale skin is just part of my natural god-like beauty. Dora: No, I\u2019m pretty sure the pale skin means you\u2019re bleeding out. Physical Appearance \u00b6 Even though Julian\u2019s not necessarily the strongest or the most stereotypical male model, he does get attention of ladies using his natural charm. Oftentimes he\u2019s carrying himself in a confident, cocky manner \u2013 sometimes just to annoy people like Dora and Ben but no one can deny him his naturally likeableness which he mostly puts on in professional settings...to his friends he\u2019s kind of an a-hole at times. His style can be best described as business casual adventurer. He wears slim fit dress shirts of a decent quality paired with more casual pants (also slim cut) over which he has a short coat \u2013 also fitted, to compliment his figure and sometimes additional short, hooded cloak to hide his identity. Overall, the priority is elegance & practicality. Julian\u2019s quite pale and slim, which may not be a result of a fast metabolism but more so his debatable lifestyle choices. Ranging from insomnia and lack of eating to the occasional drug abuse and finally, overextending his magic abilities quite often. For this, he\u2019s received a handful of \u201cyou look like a zombie\u201d comments over the years. His face is quite slim as well and he has prominent cheekbones, but doesn\u2019t look outright skeleton-y, he\u2019s actually very charismatic. His hair is slightly wavy, but not noticeably. He has a mid-length shaggy haircut (longer back, shorter front with somewhat of a fringe parted in the middle) - sometimes called \u201csurfer hair\u201d except he\u2019s not blond but brunet. Skills \u00b6 Special Abilities: Advanced Magic Powers including Telepathy, Telekinesis, Spacetime Manipulation, Expertise in Mind Control Skills: Almost encyclopaedic knowledge at times Weapons of Choice: Carries around a sword at times but heavily relies on magic most of the time Character Arc within the main story \u00b6 Dora first met Julian through his brother Benedict. Together, along with Ben\u2019s criminal \u201corganisation\u201d called The Cult (which has 4 members), they successfully staged a caper and managed to rob the royal treasury. After that Dora and Julian formed an unlikely alliance, sometimes working together, sometimes working against each other. With The Cult, they faced Carter, the main antagonist, powerful sorcerer also the most confusing character of them all...very dangerous man indeed. Over the years Dora and Julian have found themselves in various situations, which strengthened their bond (although neither of them would admit that), they were imprisoned and then escaped Shinkanai Mafia, have both taken part of a larger journey along with other character, Leon Shelton to avert the ending of the world and find out the true purpose of Khar\u00ed Alemaam (see Leon Shelton for more details) and many more endeavours.

His mother Elisa Hemrey, was of Elven descent, born and raised in Death's Door, moved to Infinitium at age 24, where she met Leon's father Edgar Shelton (also known as Shadow and Edgar Timothy Bradbury) at an art auction (she was an excellent artist). Leon had really good relationship with his mother but his father was cold and distant to him since he was born. He was obssesed his work (trying to get back to his timeline), thus neglecting Leon. Leon inherited his magic powers from his father, but he always dreamt of being an alchemist or an inventor of some sorts. He accomplished this dream at age of 20, when he started officialy working in Shelton Industries as a chemist. He's now the vice CEO, but he mostly tinkers with stuff in the lab and hates all the formal meetings. 8 years ago (age 15) he's been in an accident. The whole family went every year on holidays in Fallholt. Normally Edgar teleported the whole family but he was out of spell slots and Elisa suggested they can go through the Forbidden forest, like an adventure. Edgar thought it ridiculous but both Elisa and Leon were excited so he allowed it. During the trip Leon got lost and found the Well of Knowledge.
